# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
MONAI takes security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please report it as soon as possible.

To report a security issue:
* please use the GitHub Security Advisories tab to "[Open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/new)".
* Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any possible mitigations.
* If applicable, please also attach proof-of-concept code or screenshots.
* We aim to acknowledge your report within 72 hours and provide a status update as we investigate.
* Please do not create public issues for security-related reports.

## Disclosure Policy
* We follow a coordinated disclosure approach.
* We will not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix has been developed and released.
* Credit will be given to researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, if requested.
## Acknowledgements
We greatly appreciate contributions from the security community and strive to recognize all researchers who help keep MONAI safe.
